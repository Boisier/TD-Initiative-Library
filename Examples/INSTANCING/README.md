# Instancing Examples

## Example 1

Shows how to copy a geometry according to the point structure of another geometry.

**Custom parameters**

	* Select instanced SOP : allows you to select the instanced geometry.
	* Select source SOP : allows you to select the source geometry.




## Example 2

Shows how to transform instances according to a waveform.

**Custom parameters**

	* Select instanced SOP : allows you to select the instanced geometry.
	* Select pattern : allows you to select the waveform to apply to the instances.




## Example 3

Shows how to color instances according to a TOP noise.

**Custom parameters**

	* Select instanced SOP : allows you to select the instanced geometry.
	* Select source SOP : allows you to select the source geometry.
	* Select pattern : allows you to select the waveform to apply to the instances.
